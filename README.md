- **Default Movies**: Displays a default set of movies (e.g., Marvel movies) when the search query is empty.
- **Movie Details**: View detailed information about a selected movie, including plot, genre, director, and rating.
- **Pagination**: Load more results with a "Show More" button.
- **Loading Spinner**: Provides user feedback with a loading spinner during API requests.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Structure of the application.
- **CSS**: Styling of the application with Tailwind CSS and custom styles.
- **JavaScript**: Functionality including debouncing, API requests, and dynamic content rendering.
